OS Concepts:
------------
	OS Intro:
	--------
		Definition:
		-----------
		
		It is a complex software which acts as an interface between user and hardware.
			
		Two types of interfaces:

			CLI --> Command Line Interface (Keyboard)
			GUI --> Graphical User Interface (Mouse/Pointer)
			
		UNIX as an OS --> 
			Was introduced in 1969 ---> 
			in 1973 re-written in C language
			
			
		OS 
			---> User interface (UI)
			---> Hardware interface (Core Part)
			
		In Unix:
			The CLI (UI) is referred to as shell 
			The Core part is referred to as kernel
			
		UNIX/Linux:
		-----------
			UNIX/Linux OS supports different types of files.
			These can be identified by the first character while using 'ls -l' command 
			
			- --> regular file (user data)
			
			d --> directory
			l --> symbolic link(short cut)
			
			p --> named pipe(FIFO)
			s --> socket 
			
			b --> Block Special device 
			c --> character Special device
	=================================================
	Kernel:
		Referred to the core part/ heart of the OS (The actual part).
		
		The major part of the OS is to manage the resources. so your kernel acts as the resource manager. 
		
		1. hardware/device management
		2. process management
		3. memory management
		4. network management
		5. file management
		.

===================================================
Shell:
------
	Command interpreter in UNIX/Linux. 
	
	The original shell introduced with the UNIX is referred to as Bourne Shell(sh)
	BSD --> csh --> C Shell
	Solaris --> ksh --> korn Shell
	Linux --> bash --> Bourne Again Shell
	
	What is a command?
		
	types of commands ?
		1. keyword/reserved word 
			 ! case  coproc  do done elif else esac fi for function if in select then until while { } time [[ ]]
		2. alias 
			user defined internal command. Creating shortcut to existing commands. Session specific.  
		3. builtin 
			 :, ., [, alias, bg, bind, break, builtin, case, cd,  command,  compgen,  complete, continue, declare, dirs, disown, echo, enable, eval, exec, exit, export, fc, fg,  getopts,  hash, help, history, if, jobs, kill, let, local, logout, popd, printf, pushd, pwd, read, readonly,  return,  set, shift, shopt, source, suspend, test, times,  trap,  type,  typeset,  ulimit, umask, unalias, unset, until, wait, while.
		4. function 
				
		5. External commands.
			binary/executable file present in PATH variable specified directories.

Commands in Linux:
------------------
	We categorize commands, so we remember it
	
	general purpose commands 
		ls , date , pwd, man, info 
	
	directory related commands. 
		mkdir, cd , rmdir 
		
	file related commands:
		cp, mv, rm , rename 
	
	file attribute related commands:
		chmod, chown, chgrp, touch, ln
		
	file data related commands / filter commands 
		I/O Redirection, command piping
		vi editor,
		
		cat, wc, tr, cut, sort, cmp, comm,  diff,  patch, 

	compression 
		tar, 
		zip/unzip, gzip/gunzip, bzip2

	UNIX/Linux shell is case sensitive

	fileA.txt --> 500 bytes 
				512 --> 
	fileA.txt --> 13k bytes 
				512 --> 1 BLOCKS size 
				26 BLOCKS should be used 
					--> 26 addresses should be stored
	fileA.txt --> 1 M bytes --> 1024 * 512 * 2
				512 --> 1 BLOCKS size 
				2048 BLOCKS should be used 
					--> 2048 addresses should be stored
=======================================================
	cd 
		/home/sudhakar  --> home directory --> ~ 
		
	~$	 cd /usr/bin
			absolute path 
	~$	 cd ../../usr/bin/
			relative path
