Constructors and Destructor
---------------------------
	These are all special methods/member functions in a class.
	1. the name is same as class name 
	2. do not have any return type not even void 
	3. the are automatically called when an object is created.
	
	Destructor:
		~className(){
		} 
===============================================================
Different members of a class 
	const members
		const data members 
		const methods/member functions
	mutable data members
	static members 
	
	Pointer as a data members	
		Shallow copy
		Deep copy 
		
	default ctor synthesis
	copy ctor[parameter,return values]
	R-value object,R-value Reference and reference collapse
	Explicit ctor
	Heap, Malloc,new , delete, new[] and delete[]
	Deep Copy v/s Shallow Copy
		shallow copy with ownership transfer
		shallow copy with reference count	
	
	
	class Employee{
		const int id; //instance
		string name; //instance member 
		mutable double salary; //non-const instance member 
		
		static string compName; //class members
	};
	
	
	When a class has a const data member, then in your constructors (ctors) we use initializer list for initialization of const data members 
	
		Sample(int x = 0): data(x) //initialization
		{
			//data = x ; //assignment 
		}
